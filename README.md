# ARxMD

ARxMD® as the Architectural Medicine Software Solution, is an important part of Architectural Medicine®, the Architectural Doctor®, and the Architectural Medicine System (AMS). Pronounced "arcs med," ARxMD is utilized to define the integrations between the architecture and medical fields to provide cohesive solutions focused on health and wellness in the built environment.

Architectural Medicine LLC is focused on the topics of health and wellness in the built environment. The intent of Architectural Medicine is to help integrate these fields of Architecture and Medicine for the General Public, as well as for the beneficial integrations between Architecture and Medicine. The main goal is to help define these various fields and to participate in creating bridges between these professions in how they might all fit together.

In this way, the average person as the General Public can feel empowered to make the best decisions for themselves, their families, and the future. Yet it’s also important to recognize that the professionals in these fields also deserve to have an integrated approach so they can address client and patient issues, while utilizing best practices for health, healing, and wellness.

The built environment has become much more complex over the past several decades with larger numbers of the population spending more time indoors than ever before. The amount of time spent indoors, on average, has risen to 60 to 90 percent, and with the advent of the novel coronavirus pandemic, those percentages have increased to 100 percent for many.

## The Built Environment as a Health Metric – Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)

The fields of Architecture and Medicine have changed quite a bit in the past fifty years, and while there have been many beneficial developments in each of these very large fields, there are still gaps relative to health in the built environment.

There are currently very few overlaps between the fields of architecture and medicine to ensure healthy built environments, including the fact that very few doctors include their patient's buildings in their health evaluations. As well, the average architect is often not trained in human health, and therefore may not be aware of the issues that certain buildings can create.

This includes the increasingly popular developments in the topics of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) providing the potential for overlap between these fields of architecture and medicine.

## Architectural Medicine and the Architectural Doctor

One of the key facets of the modern day world is the development of technology in these professional fields. Both architecture and medicine have developed in this realm with tremendous advancements in the electronic and digital worlds, from CAD and BIM in architecture to the digital processes of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in medical processes.

Both Architectural Medicine and the Architectural Doctor are focused on utilizing these new processes to benefit the two fields to provide better health and wellness in the built environment.

## Interoperability in Architecture and Medicine

With all of this information on what is not being done, what can be done?

The HL7 Organization provides standards to provide more advanced processes to integrate data using more standardized data interconnectivity. These integrations include SNOMED, ICD, and LOINC as integral parts of these medical codification processes.

This includes the latest HL7 development called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), which utilizes the more common REST API standards used in software development to allow different medical software applications to talk to one another and exchange data.

ARxMD strives to provide this interoperability between both the architecture and the medical fields using these digital integrations using HL7 FHIR and the many possibilities that these APIs can provide.
